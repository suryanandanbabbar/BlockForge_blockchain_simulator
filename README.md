# BlockForge: Blockchain Simulator
**BlockForge** is an interactive iOS application that simulates the core workings of a blockchain system â€” from wallet creation and transactions to proof-of-work mining and ledger validation.  
Built using **Swift** and **SwiftUI**, it provides a hands-on way for students, developers, and blockchain enthusiasts to explore the underlying mechanics of decentralized systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- macOS with **Xcode 15** or later
- iOS 17+ target device or simulator

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suryanandanbabbar/BlockForge_blockchain_simulator.git
   ```
2. Open BlockForge.xcodeproj in Xcode.
3. Select your target device or simulator.
4. Build and run (Cmd + R).

## How It Works
1. Wallet Creation
  Each wallet is assigned a public address for sending and receiving transactions.
2. Transaction Flow
  Transactions are created, signed, and broadcasted to the blockchain.
3. Mining Process
  Blocks are mined using the proof-of-work algorithm, where miners solve computational puzzles to add blocks.
4. Ledger Updates
  Upon successful mining, the blockchain updates and rewards are added to the miner's wallet.

## Purpose
BlockForge is designed for educational purposes, enabling users to interactively explore:
- How blocks are created and linked
- How transactions are validated
- How mining difficulty impacts block generation
